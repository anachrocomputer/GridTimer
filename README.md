# GridTimer #

Arduino sketch to show a timer on a 16x16 grid of LED pixels.
As time passes, pixels are lit up at random until they're all on.

Runs on AVR Arduino such as the Duemilanove.
LED display based on four MAX7219 modules,
each with 8x8 pixel LED display.

Based on another sketch; many comments will be incorrect as yet.
